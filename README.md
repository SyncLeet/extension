### Setup Instructions

1. Install dependencies by running `yarn install`.
2. Depending on your use case, execute the following scripts:
   - `yarn build` to build the project.
   - `yarn watch` to continuously build the project as files change.
3. Enable developer mode in your Chrome browser by navigating to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions).
4. Click on "Load unpacked" and select the dist folder to install the extension.

### Caveats

1. Note that yarn watch will not automatically reload the extension. You must manually reload the extension on the [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) page.
2. LeetSync has not been tested or officially supported on Firefox. Contributions are welcome!
